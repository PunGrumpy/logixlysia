## General

### What is Logixlysia?

Logixlysia is a high-performance logging plugin for [Elysia.js](https://elysiajs.com/) that provides structured logging powered by [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino). It offers flexible configuration, file logging, and seamless integration with Elysia applications.

### Why use Logixlysia instead of plain Pino?

Logixlysia provides:
- Automatic request/response logging
- Elysia plugin integration
- Built-in file logging with rotation
- Custom transport support
- Simple configuration API
- TypeScript support

### Is Logixlysia production-ready?

Yes, Logixlysia is built for production environments. It's powered by Pino, which is battle-tested in production, and includes features like log rotation, filtering, and transport support.

## Installation

### How do I install Logixlysia?

```bash
bun add logixlysia
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm install logixlysia
```

### What are the requirements?

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- Elysia.js

## Configuration

### How do I disable console logging?

```ts
logixlysia({
  config: {
    disableInternalLogger: true
  }
})
```

### How do I use only file logging?

```ts
logixlysia({
  config: {
    disableInternalLogger: true,
    logFilePath: './logs/app.log'
  }
})
```

### How do I use only transports?

```ts
logixlysia({
  config: {
    useTransportsOnly: true,
    transports: [myTransport]
  }
})
```

### How do I configure different settings for development and production?

```ts
const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'

logixlysia({
  config: {
    showStartupMessage: isDev,
    pino: {
      level: isDev ? 'debug' : 'info',
      prettyPrint: isDev
    }
  }
})
```

## Usage

### How do I access the logger in route handlers?

```ts
app.get('/users/:id', ({ store }) => {
  const { logger, pino } = store
  
  // Use logger helper
  logger.info(request, 'User accessed')
  
  // Or use Pino directly
  pino.info('User accessed')
  
  return { user: 'data' }
})
```

### How do I log custom messages?

```ts
app.post('/users', ({ store, body }) => {
  const { logger } = store
  
  logger.info(request, 'Creating user', {
    email: body.email
  })
  
  return createUser(body)
})
```

### How do I create child loggers?

```ts
app.get('/orders/:id', ({ store, params }) => {
  const { pino } = store
  
  const orderLogger = pino.child({
    orderId: params.id,
    module: 'order-service'
  })
  
  orderLogger.info('Processing order')
  
  return getOrder(params.id)
})
```

## File Logging

### How do I enable file logging?

```ts
logixlysia({
  config: {
    logFilePath: './logs/app.log'
  }
})
```

### How does log rotation work?

Log rotation automatically manages log file sizes and retention:

```ts
logRotation: {
  maxSize: '10m',    // Rotate when file reaches 10MB
  interval: '1d',    // Also rotate daily
  maxFiles: '7d',   // Keep logs for 7 days
  compress: true     // Compress rotated logs
}
```

### Can I use multiple log files?

Currently, Logixlysia supports a single log file path. For multiple files, use custom transports.

## Transports

### How do I create a custom transport?

```ts
const myTransport = {
  log: async (level, message, meta) => {
    // Your logging logic here
    await sendToService(level, message, meta)
  }
}

logixlysia({
  config: {
    transports: [myTransport]
  }
})
```

### Can I use multiple transports?

Yes, you can use multiple transports:

```ts
logixlysia({
  config: {
    transports: [
      elasticsearchTransport,
      slackTransport,
      mongodbTransport
    ]
  }
})
```

## Performance

### What is the performance impact?

Logixlysia is built on Pino, one of the fastest Node.js loggers. The performance impact is minimal, especially when using async transports.

### Should I use file logging in production?

File logging is recommended for production environments. Use log rotation to manage disk space and consider compression for space savings.

### How do I reduce logging overhead?

- Use log filtering to log only important events
- Use appropriate log levels
- Consider using transports for high-volume scenarios
- Disable pretty printing in production

## Troubleshooting

### Logs are not appearing

Check:
1. Log level configuration
2. Log filter settings
3. Output control settings (`disableInternalLogger`, `disableFileLogging`)
4. File permissions for file logging

### File rotation is not working

Ensure:
1. `logFilePath` is set
2. File has write permissions
3. `maxSize` or `interval` is configured
4. Check console for rotation errors

### Pino pretty printing not working

Make sure:
1. `pino.prettyPrint` is set to `true`
2. You're in development mode (pretty printing is typically disabled in production)
3. You have `pino-pretty` installed if using transport-based pretty printing

### Transports are not receiving logs

Check:
1. Transport is properly configured
2. Transport `log` method is not throwing errors
3. `useTransportsOnly` is not conflicting with other settings
4. Check console for transport errors

## Migration

### How do I migrate from another logging library?

1. Install Logixlysia
2. Replace your logging setup with `logixlysia()`
3. Update log calls to use `store.logger` or `store.pino`
4. Configure transports if needed

### Is Logixlysia backward compatible?

Logixlysia maintains backward compatibility within major versions. Check the changelog for breaking changes between versions.
