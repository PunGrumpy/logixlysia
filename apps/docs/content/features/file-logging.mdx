description: Save logs to files for persistence
---

Save your logs to files for persistence and analysis using Logixlysia's file logging system.

## Basic Usage

```ts
logixlysia({
  config: {
    logFilePath: './logs/app.log'
  }
})
```

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `logFilePath` | `string` | Path to the log file | `undefined` |

## File Format

Logs are written in a structured format:

```
🦊 2025-04-13 15:00:19.225 INFO  123.45ms GET /api/users 200 
🦊 2025-04-13 15:00:20.225 ERROR 234.56ms POST /api/users 500 Error creating user
```

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive file names
- Organize logs by type/level
- Consider using date-based directories
- Set appropriate file permissions
- Avoid logging sensitive data
- Regular log review and cleanup

## Examples

### Production

```ts
logFilePath: './logs/production.log'
```

### Development

```ts
logFilePath: './logs/development.log'
```
